I'm a software engineer from Chicago. 
Currently I am a senior software enginer at [Abbott Laboratories](https://abbott.com), where I work on consent management, platforms and integrations. 

Previousely, I managed shopping orchestration microservices at [United Airlines](https://united.com), and developed enterprise chat platforms at [Accenture](https://accenture.com).

I graduated with a BS in Biology from Loyola University Chicago and an MS in CS from Northeastern Illinois Univeristy where I did some [research into recommendation engines](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3603287.3656163). 


My 2025 learning plan includes:
  - [x] diving into some "classical literature" with the [C Programming Language](https://github.com/himynameisoleg/the-c-programming-language)
  - [x] sharpenning the saw with some [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)
  - [x] getting low with [Rust in Action](https://www.rustinaction.com)
  - [x] getting Swifty and building an [iOS app](https://github.com/himynameisoleg/AIQuest) using SwiftUI, SwiftData with content powered by Google Gemini
  - [ ] diving into [this wonderful blog](https://os.phil-opp.com) and learn what it take to build a [kernel and bootable OS in Rust](https://github.com/himynameisoleg/null-pointer-os)
