- 👋 Hi, I’m Oleg a software engineer from Chicago.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages, low level porogramming, recommendation engines, GenAI, RAG LLMs and cloud architectures. 
- 🌱 In 2024 I learned:
  - [x] how to build and deploy a RAG LLM on Azure
  - [x] how to write a [Compiler and Interpreter in Go](https://github.com/himynameisoleg/monkey-language)
  - [x] the basics of the [Rust Programming Language](https://github.com/himynameisoleg/the-rust-programming-language)
    
- 🌱 In 2025 I plan to:
  - [ ] dive into some "classical literature" with the [C Programming Language](https://github.com/himynameisoleg/the-c-programming-language)
  - [ ] sharpening the saw with [Rust in Action](https://www.rustinaction.com)
  - [ ] follow along this [amazing blog](https://os.phil-opp.com) and learn what it take to build a [kernel and bootable OS in Rust](https://github.com/himynameisoleg/null-pointer-os)
